# Legacy-booting-Logic-Bomb
I wrote this code in 2013 just to see if it could be done.  At the time there were a lot more legacy booting devices that checked for a bootable optical disk first
In case you're wondering: I created one disk, put it IN MY OWN MACHInE on startup, advanced the date reversed the process, then physically destroyed that disk.  This code was never used maliciously.
